    Enhancing Trust in Autonomous Agents: An Architecture for Accountability and Explainability through Blockchain and Large Language Models

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09567)

    通过区块链和大型语言模型实现责任和可解释性的架构，提高自主代理的信任和安全性，增强代理与用户之间的沟通效果。

    

    自主代理在涉及人类互动的环境中的部署日益引起安全关注。因此，了解事件背后的情况变得至关重要，需要开发能够向非专家用户解释其行为的能力。这些解释在提高可信度和安全性方面至关重要，作为防范失败、错误和误解的措施。此外，它们有助于改善沟通，弥合代理和用户之间的差距，从而提高它们相互作用的效果。这项工作提出了一种为基于ROS的移动机器人实施的责任和可解释性架构。所提出的解决方案包括两个主要组件。首先，一个类似黑盒的元素用于提供问责制，具有通过区块链技术实现的防篡改属性。其次，一个负责的组件

    arXiv:2403.09567v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of
