    本文旨在解构人工智能责任的概念，提出了一种包含四种责任意义的有效组合，以支持对人工智能责任的实践推理。

    

    为了在涉及人工智能系统的复杂情况下合理思考责任应该放在何处，我们首先需要一个足够清晰和详细的跨学科词汇来谈论责任。责任是一种三元关系，涉及到一个行为者、一个事件和一种责任方式。作为一种有意识的为了支持对人工智能责任进行实践推理的“解构”责任概念的努力，本文采取了“行为者A对事件O负责”的三部分表述，并确定了A、负责、O的子类别的有效组合。这些有效组合我们称之为“责任串”，分为四种责任意义：角色责任、因果责任、法律责任和道德责任。我们通过两个运行示例进行了说明，一个涉及医疗AI系统，另一个涉及AV与行人的致命碰撞。

    To reason about where responsibility does and should lie in complex situations involving AI-enabled systems, we first need a sufficiently clear and detailed cross-disciplinary vocabulary for talking about responsibility. Responsibility is a triadic relation involving an actor, an occurrence, and a way of being responsible. As part of a conscious effort towards 'unravelling' the concept of responsibility to support practical reasoning about responsibility for AI, this paper takes the three-part formulation, 'Actor A is responsible for Occurrence O' and identifies valid combinations of subcategories of A, is responsible for, and O. These valid combinations - which we term "responsibility strings" - are grouped into four senses of responsibility: role-responsibility; causal responsibility; legal liability-responsibility; and moral responsibility. They are illustrated with two running examples, one involving a healthcare AI-based system and another the fatal collision of an AV with a pedes
