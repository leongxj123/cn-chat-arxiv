    本文综述了自主驾驶系统中基于学习的相机和激光雷达仿真方法的最新研究现状。

    

    感知传感器，尤其是相机和激光雷达，是自主驾驶系统(Autonomous Driving Systems，ADS)的关键元素，使其能够理解周围环境以做出明智的驾驶和控制决策。因此，开发逼真的相机和激光雷达模拟方法，也称为相机和激光雷达模型，对于有效进行基于仿真的ADS测试至关重要。此外，基于深度学习的感知模型的兴起，促进了感知传感器模型作为合成各种训练数据集的有价值工具的普及。传统传感器仿真方法依赖于计算密集型的基于物理的算法，特别是在复杂系统如ADS中。因此，目前的潜力在于基于学习的模型，受到深度生成模型在合成高维数据方面取得成功的推动。本文综述了基于学习的传感器仿真方法的最新研究现状。

    arXiv:2402.10079v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Perception sensors, particularly camera and Lidar, are key elements of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) that enable them to comprehend their surroundings for informed driving and control decisions. Therefore, developing realistic camera and Lidar simulation methods, also known as camera and Lidar models, is of paramount importance to effectively conduct simulation-based testing for ADS. Moreover, the rise of deep learning-based perception models has propelled the prevalence of perception sensor models as valuable tools for synthesising diverse training datasets. The traditional sensor simulation methods rely on computationally expensive physics-based algorithms, specifically in complex systems such as ADS. Hence, the current potential resides in learning-based models, driven by the success of deep generative models in synthesising high-dimensional data. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art in learning-based sensor simulation
