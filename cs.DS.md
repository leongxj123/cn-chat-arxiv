[^1]: 学习性是一种紧凑性质

    Learnability is a Compact Property

    监督学习问题的困难性具有紧凑的有限特性表征。

    

    最近关于学习的工作取得了一个引人注目的结果：各种问题的可学习性可能是不可判定的，或者与标准集合论ZFC公理无关。此外，这种问题的可学习性可能不是具有有限特性的属性：非正式地说，它不能通过检查问题的有限投影来检测。

    arXiv:2402.10360v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent work on learning has yielded a striking result: the learnability of various problems can be undecidable, or independent of the standard ZFC axioms of set theory. Furthermore, the learnability of such problems can fail to be a property of finite character: informally, it cannot be detected by examining finite projections of the problem.   On the other hand, learning theory abounds with notions of dimension that characterize learning and consider only finite restrictions of the problem, i.e., are properties of finite character. How can these results be reconciled? More precisely, which classes of learning problems are vulnerable to logical undecidability, and which are within the grasp of finite characterizations?   We demonstrate that the difficulty of supervised learning with metric losses admits a tight finite characterization. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of learning a hypothesis class can be detected by ex
