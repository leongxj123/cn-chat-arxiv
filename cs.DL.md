    这项国际跨学科调查发现，作者署名的冲突问题非常普遍，并且往往在学者的职业生涯早期就开始出现。

    

    学者间的合作已成为当代科学的重要特征，因此在出版物中列出的作者数量不断上升。然而，确定应该包括哪些作者以及他们的顺序涉及多种困难，往往会导致冲突。尽管关于学术冲突的大量文献，但它在主要社会人口学特征以及学术界经历的不同类型的交互方面的分布仍不清楚。为了填补这一差距，我们进行了一项国际跨学科调查，受到了来自41个研究领域和93个国家的752名学者的统计学代表整体学术劳动力的回答。我们的发现令人担忧，表明作者署名冲突在一个人的学术生涯早期即产生，甚至在硕士和博士水平上就普遍出现。

    Collaboration among scholars has emerged as a significant characteristic of contemporary science. As a result, the number of authors listed in publications continues to rise steadily. Unfortunately, determining the authors to be included in the byline and their respective order entails multiple difficulties which often lead to conflicts. Despite the large volume of literature about conflicts in academia, it remains unclear how exactly it is distributed over the main socio-demographic properties, as well as the different types of interactions academics experience. To address this gap, we conducted an international and cross-disciplinary survey answered by 752 academics from 41 fields of research and 93 countries that statistically well-represent the overall academic workforce. Our findings are concerning and suggest that authorship credit conflicts arise very early in one's academic career, even at the level of Master and Ph.D., and become increasingly common over time.
