    本文旨在提供对模式分析与机器智能领域文献综述的全面评估，引入大语言模型驱动的文献计量指标，并构建了RiPAMI元数据数据库和主题数据集以获取PAMI综述的统计特征。

    

    通过整合分散的知识，文献综述提供了对所研究主题的全面了解。然而，在模式分析与机器智能（PAMI）这一蓬勃发展的领域中，过多的综述引起了研究人员和评论者的关注。作为对这些关注的回应，本文旨在从多个角度全面审视PAMI领域的综述文献。

    arXiv:2402.12928v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: By consolidating scattered knowledge, the literature review provides a comprehensive understanding of the investigated topic. However, excessive reviews, especially in the booming field of pattern analysis and machine intelligence (PAMI), raise concerns for both researchers and reviewers. In response to these concerns, this Analysis aims to provide a thorough review of reviews in the PAMI field from diverse perspectives. First, large language model-empowered bibliometric indicators are proposed to evaluate literature reviews automatically. To facilitate this, a meta-data database dubbed RiPAMI, and a topic dataset are constructed, which are utilized to obtain statistical characteristics of PAMI reviews. Unlike traditional bibliometric measurements, the proposed article-level indicators provide real-time and field-normalized quantified assessments of reviews without relying on user-defined keywords. Second, based on these indicators, th
