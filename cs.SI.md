    本综述调查了图神经网络（GNNs）在不同形式定义下增强表达能力的模型，并对图特征增强、图拓扑增强和GNNs架构增强进行了综述和讨论。

    

    图神经网络（GNNs）是许多与图相关的应用中有效的机器学习模型。尽管在实践中取得了成功，但许多研究工作集中在GNNs的理论限制，即其表达能力。早期的研究主要关注GNNs的图同构识别能力，而最近的研究尝试利用子图计数和连接学习等属性来描述GNNs的表达能力，这更加实际且更接近实际应用。然而，目前还没有关于此方向的综述论文和开源仓库综合总结和讨论这些模型。为了填补这个空白，我们首次对不同形式定义下增强表达能力的模型进行了综述。具体而言，基于三个类别对模型进行了评述，即图特征增强、图拓扑增强和GNNs架构增强。

    Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective machine learning models for many graph-related applications. Despite their empirical success, many research efforts focus on the theoretical limitations of GNNs, i.e., the GNNs expressive power. Early works in this domain mainly focus on studying the graph isomorphism recognition ability of GNNs, and recent works try to leverage the properties such as subgraph counting and connectivity learning to characterize the expressive power of GNNs, which are more practical and closer to real-world. However, no survey papers and open-source repositories comprehensively summarize and discuss models in this important direction. To fill the gap, we conduct a first survey for models for enhancing expressive power under different forms of definition. Concretely, the models are reviewed based on three categories, i.e., Graph feature enhancement, Graph topology enhancement, and GNNs architecture enhancement.
