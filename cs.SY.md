    人工智能中的对齐工作旨在追求模型响应与人类偏好和价值的一致性。本文引入了可控偏好优化（CPO）方法，明确为不同目标指定偏好分数，从而引导模型生成符合需求的响应。实验分析表明，经过对齐的模型可以提供符合各种偏好的响应。

    arXiv:2402.19085v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Alignment in artificial intelligence pursues the consistency between model responses and human preferences as well as values. In practice, the multifaceted nature of human preferences inadvertently introduces what is known as the "alignment tax" -a compromise where enhancements in alignment within one objective (e.g.,harmlessness) can diminish performance in others (e.g.,helpfulness). However, existing alignment techniques are mostly unidirectional, leading to suboptimal trade-offs and poor flexibility over various objectives. To navigate this challenge, we argue the prominence of grounding LLMs with evident preferences. We introduce controllable preference optimization (CPO), which explicitly specifies preference scores for different objectives, thereby guiding the model to generate responses that meet the requirements. Our experimental analysis reveals that the aligned models can provide responses that match various preferences among t
