[^1]: 因果平等保护与算法公平性

    Causal Equal Protection as Algorithmic Fairness

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12062](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12062)

    本文提出了一种新的算法公平性原则——平等保护，其关键在于将错误分类的风险均等化，避免了许多对传统分类平等原则的反例。

    

    过去十年，计算机科学和哲学的文献形成了不同的算法公平性标准。其中最受争议的分类平等要求，预测算法的错误分类在被保护特征所指示的群体中以相等频率发生。尽管分类平等具有直观吸引力，但已受到攻击。我们转向一个相关原则，即平等保护，该原则最初是在刑事司法领域发展起来的。平等保护的关键在于将错误分类的风险（将在规定的意义上具体说明）进行均等化，而不是将错误分类的比率均等化。我们展示了平等保护避免了许多对分类平等的反例。

    arXiv:2402.12062v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Over the last ten years the literature in computer science and philosophy has formulated different criteria of algorithmic fairness. One of the most discussed, classification parity, requires that the erroneous classifications of a predictive algorithm occur with equal frequency for groups picked out by protected characteristics. Despite its intuitive appeal, classification parity has come under attack. Multiple scenarios can be imagined in which - intuitively - a predictive algorithm does not treat any individual unfairly, and yet classification parity is violated. To make progress, we turn to a related principle, equal protection, originally developed in the context of criminal justice. Key to equal protection is equalizing the risks of erroneous classifications (in a sense to be specified) as opposed to equalizing the rates of erroneous classifications. We show that equal protection avoids many of the counterexamples to classificati
