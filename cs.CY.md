    Breast Cancer Classification Using Gradient Boosting Algorithms Focusing on Reducing the False Negative and SHAP for Explainability

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09548](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09548)

    本研究使用梯度提升算法对乳腺癌进行分类，关注提高召回率，以实现更好的检测和预测效果。

    

    癌症是世界上夺走最多女性生命的疾病之一，其中乳腺癌占据了癌症病例和死亡人数最高的位置。然而，通过早期检测可以预防乳腺癌，从而进行早期治疗。许多研究关注的是在癌症预测中具有高准确性的模型，但有时仅依靠准确性可能并非始终可靠。本研究对使用提升技术基于不同机器学习算法预测乳腺癌的性能进行了调查性研究，重点关注召回率指标。提升机器学习算法已被证明是检测医学疾病的有效工具。利用加州大学尔湾分校 (UCI) 数据集对训练和测试模型分类器进行训练，其中包含各自属性。

    arXiv:2403.09548v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that contains their attributes. Th
    
[^2]: 大型语言模型的预测排名

    Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17826](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17826)

    该研究提出了一种统计框架，可以衡量人类与模型偏好之间的不确定性，从而进行大型语言模型的预测排名。

    

    大型语言模型通常根据其与人类偏好的一致性水平进行排名--如果一个模型的输出更受人类偏好，那么它就比其他模型更好。本文提出了一种统计框架来弥合人类与模型偏好之间可能引入的不一致性。

    arXiv:2402.17826v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the most popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a very common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a small set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provid

    智能建筑越来越多地使用基于物联网的无线传感系统来降低能源消耗和环境影响。本研究的主要贡献是开发了一个全面的基于物联网的智能城市能源管理框架，融合了多个物联网架构和框架的组件。该框架通过智能分析，不仅收集和存储信息，而且还是其他企业开发应用的平台。此外，我们还研究了基于智能机制的智能能源管理解决方案。能源资源的消耗和需求增加导致了节能与优化管理的需求和挑战。

    Smart buildings are increasingly using Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless sensing systems to reduce their energy consumption and environmental impact. As a result of their compact size and ability to sense, measure, and compute all electrical properties, Internet of Things devices have become increasingly important in our society. A major contribution of this study is the development of a comprehensive IoT-based framework for smart city energy management, incorporating multiple components of IoT architecture and framework. An IoT framework for intelligent energy management applications that employ intelligent analysis is an essential system component that collects and stores information. Additionally, it serves as a platform for the development of applications by other companies. Furthermore, we have studied intelligent energy management solutions based on intelligent mechanisms. The depletion of energy resources and the increase in energy demand have led to an increase in energy
