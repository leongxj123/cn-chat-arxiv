    本研究通过手机数据发现，在COVID-19大流行期间，生活在低财富社区的城市用户更不可能采取自我隔离的行动，贫穷用户中那些曾经通勤上班到高财富社区的人则特别容易受到影响。

    

    手机数据在量化COVID-19疫情期间的人类流动中发挥了关键作用。现有研究主要关注高收入国家的地区总体情况，掩盖了疫情对最脆弱群体的强烈影响。我们结合来自移动电话和人口普查的地理位置数据，研究了2020年3月至12月期间3个大洲的6个中等收入国家，揭示了不同社会经济群体应对疫情的行为差异。当疫情爆发时，生活在低财富社区中的城市用户更不可能通过自我隔离在家中、搬迁到农村地区或者停止通勤工作来应对。贫穷用户中，那些在疫情之前曾通勤上班到高财富社区的人则面临着重大风险。

    Mobile phone data have played a key role in quantifying human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing studies on mobility patterns have primarily focused on regional aggregates in high-income countries, obfuscating the accentuated impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable populations. By combining geolocation data from mobile phones and population census for 6 middle-income countries across 3 continents between March and December 2020, we uncovered common disparities in the behavioral response to the pandemic across socioeconomic groups. When the pandemic hit, urban users living in low-wealth neighborhoods were less likely to respond by self-isolating at home, relocating to rural areas, or refraining from commuting to work. The gap in the behavioral responses between socioeconomic groups persisted during the entire observation period. Among low-wealth users, those who used to commute to work in high-wealth neighborhoods pre-pandemic were particularly at risk, facing both th
