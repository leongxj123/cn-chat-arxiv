    说服游戏在经济和人工智能研究中具有重要意义并具有重要的实际应用。本文探讨了在基于语言的说服游戏中离线策略评估（OPE）的挑战性问题，提出了一种结合真实和模拟人类 - 机器人交互数据的新方法，并给出了一种深度学习训练算法，该算法有效地整合了真实交互和模拟数据。

    Persuasion games have been fundamental in economics and AI research, and have significant practical applications. Recent works in this area have started to incorporate natural language, moving beyond the traditional stylized message setting. However, previous research has focused on on-policy prediction, where the train and test data have the same distribution, which is not representative of real-life scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in language-based persuasion games. To address the inherent difficulty of human data collection in this setup, we propose a novel approach which combines real and simulated human-bot interaction data. Our simulated data is created by an exogenous model assuming decision makers (DMs) start with a mixture of random and decision-theoretic based behaviors and improve over time. We present a deep learning training algorithm that effectively integrates real interaction and simulated data, substantially im
