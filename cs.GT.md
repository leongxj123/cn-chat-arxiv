    Auctions with Dynamic Scoring

    研究拍卖设计中市场厚度和信息之间的权衡，特别关注一价和二价拍卖。

    

    我们研究了具有动态评分的拍卖设计，这些拍卖根据给定的评分规则分配单个物品。我们的动机来自在线广告拍卖，当用户在会话期间与平台互动时。平台根据投标和质量得分的组合对广告进行排名，并根据用户的在线活动在会话期间更新质量得分。平台必须决定何时在会话期间展示广告。通过推迟拍卖，拍卖者可以获取有关广告质量的信息，提高选择高质量广告的机会。然而，信息是有成本的，因为延迟会减少市场厚度，从而减少收入。拍卖者应该何时分配印象以平衡这些力量？我们开发了一个理论模型来研究市场设计对市场厚度和信息之间的权衡的影响。具体来说，我们关注一价和二价拍卖。

    arXiv:2403.11022v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the design of auctions with dynamic scoring, which allocate a single item according to a given scoring rule. We are motivated by online advertising auctions when users interact with a platform over the course of a session. The platform ranks ads based on a combination of bids and quality scores, and updates the quality scores throughout the session based on the user's online activity. The platform must decide when to show an ad during the session. By delaying the auction, the auctioneer acquires information about an ad's quality, improving her chances of selecting a high quality ad. However information is costly, because delay reduces market thickness and in turn revenue. When should the auctioneer allocate the impression to balance these forces?   We develop a theoretical model to study the effect of market design on the trade-off between market thickness and information. In particular, we focus on first- and second-price aucti
