    提出了有限知识下n人博弈的框架，引入了“游戏智能”机制和“防作弊性”概念，GI机制可以实际评估玩家的智能，应用广泛。

    

    本文提出了一个新的框架——有限知识下的n人博弈，其中玩家只对游戏的某些方面（包括行动、结果和其他玩家）有限的了解。为了分析这些游戏，我介绍了一组新的概念和机制，重点关注人类和机器决策之间的相互作用。具体而言，我引入了两个主要概念：第一个是“游戏智能”（GI）机制，它通过考虑参考机器智能下的“错误”，不仅仅是游戏的结果，量化了玩家在游戏中展示出的智能。第二个是“防作弊性”，这是一种实用的、可计算的策略无关性的概念。GI机制提供了一种实用的方法来评估玩家，可以潜在地应用于从在线游戏到现实生活决策的各种游戏。

    In this note, I introduce a new framework called n-person games with partial knowledge, in which players have only limited knowledge about the aspects of the game -- including actions, outcomes, and other players. For example, playing an actual game of chess is a game of partial knowledge. To analyze these games, I introduce a set of new concepts and mechanisms for measuring the intelligence of players, with a focus on the interplay between human- and machine-based decision-making. Specifically, I introduce two main concepts: firstly, the Game Intelligence (GI) mechanism, which quantifies a player's demonstrated intelligence in a game by considering not only the game's outcome but also the "mistakes" made during the game according to the reference machine's intelligence. Secondly, I define gaming-proofness, a practical and computational concept of strategy-proofness. The GI mechanism provides a practicable way to assess players and can potentially be applied to a wide range of games, f
