    该论文提出了一种新颖的方法，为用户出发地可到达的城市旅行分配可持续性指标（SF指数）。

    

    在信息过载和复杂决策过程的时代，推荐系统（RS）已成为各个领域不可或缺的工具，尤其是旅行和旅游领域。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，为用户出发地可到达的城市旅行分配可持续性指标（SF指数）。

    arXiv:2403.18604v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In an era of information overload and complex decision-making processes, Recommender Systems (RS) have emerged as indispensable tools across diverse domains, particularly travel and tourism. These systems simplify trip planning by offering personalized recommendations that consider individual preferences and address broader challenges like seasonality, travel regulations, and capacity constraints. The intricacies of the tourism domain, characterized by multiple stakeholders, including consumers, item providers, platforms, and society, underscore the complexity of achieving balance among diverse interests. Although previous research has focused on fairness in Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) from a multistakeholder perspective, limited work has focused on generating sustainable recommendations.   Our paper introduces a novel approach for assigning a sustainability indicator (SF index) for city trips accessible from the users' starting po
