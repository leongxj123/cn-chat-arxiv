    Holo-VQVAE: VQ-VAE for phase-only holograms

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01330](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01330)

    Holo-VQVAE是一种针对仅相位全息图的新型生成框架，结合了矢量量化变分自动编码器的结构，通过集成角谱方法来学习图像域，在全息图生成中实现了从复杂分布中直接生成多样化全息内容。

    

    Holography stands at the forefront of visual technology innovation, offering immersive, three-dimensional visualizations through the manipulation of light wave amplitude and phase. Contemporary research in hologram generation has predominantly focused on image-to-hologram conversion, producing holograms from existing images. These approaches, while effective, inherently limit the scope of innovation and creativity in hologram generation. In response to this limitation, we present Holo-VQVAE, a novel generative framework tailored for phase-only holograms (POHs). Holo-VQVAE leverages the architecture of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders, enabling it to learn the complex distributions of POHs. Furthermore, it integrates the Angular Spectrum Method into the training process, facilitating learning in the image domain. This framework allows for the generation of unseen, diverse holographic content directly from its intricately learned distributions.
