    建立了一个基于分位数回归的新型动态三因子模型，以解决传统宏观经济变量与收益率曲线之间相互作用建模的问题。该方法利用分位数回归的潜力来建模收益率的整个条件分布，而不仅限于其均值。对20世纪70年代的美国数据进行了应用，并显示出收益率之间的显著异质性。

    A widespread approach to modelling the interaction between macroeconomic variables and the yield curve relies on three latent factors usually interpreted as the level, slope, and curvature (Diebold et al., 2006). This approach is inherently focused on the conditional mean of the yields and postulates a dynamic linear model where the latent factors smoothly change over time. However, periods of deep crisis, such as the Great Recession and the recent pandemic, have highlighted the importance of statistical models that account for asymmetric shocks and are able to forecast the tails of a variable's distribution. A new version of the dynamic three-factor model is proposed to address this issue based on quantile regressions. The novel approach leverages the potential of quantile regression to model the entire (conditional) distribution of the yields instead of restricting to its mean. An application to US data from the 1970s shows the significant heterogeneity of the interactions between fi
