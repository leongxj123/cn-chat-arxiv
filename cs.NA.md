    本文提出了一种量子蒙特卡罗算法，用于解决高维Black-Scholes PDE的高维期权定价，其复杂度被多项式地限制，克服了维度诅咒。

    This paper proposes a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for high-dimensional option pricing by solving high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation, and proves that its computational complexity is polynomially bounded in the space dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy, overcoming the curse of dimensionality.

    本文提供了一种量子蒙特卡罗算法，用于解决具有相关性的高维Black-Scholes PDE的高维期权定价。期权的支付函数为一般形式，只需要连续且分段仿射（CPWA），涵盖了金融中使用的大多数相关支付函数。我们提供了算法的严格误差分析和复杂度分析。特别地，我们证明了我们的算法的计算复杂度在PDE的空间维度$d$和所需精度$\varepsilon$的倒数中被多项式地限制，从而证明了我们的量子蒙特卡罗算法不会受到维度诅咒的影响。

    In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ and so demonstrate that our quantum Monte Carlo algorithm does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality.
