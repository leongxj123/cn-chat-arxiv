    Duwak: Dual Watermarks in Large Language Models

    Duwak提出了一种在大型语言模型中嵌入双重秘密模式的水印技术，可以显著提高水印的效率和质量。

    

    随着大型语言模型（LLM）在文本生成任务中的日益使用，审计它们的用途、管理它们的应用并减轻其潜在危害至关重要。本文提出了Duwak，通过在令牌概率分布和抽样方案中嵌入双重秘密模式，从根本上提高了水印的效率和质量。

    arXiv:2403.13000v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: As large language models (LLM) are increasingly used for text generation tasks, it is critical to audit their usages, govern their applications, and mitigate their potential harms. Existing watermark techniques are shown effective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable patterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics. However, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of tokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against post-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances
