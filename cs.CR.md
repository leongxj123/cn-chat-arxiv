    针对每月针对视觉分类器的对抗性攻击快速演变的特性，人们提出了许多防御方法，旨在尽可能通用化以抵御尽可能多的已知攻击。然而，设计一个能够对抗所有类型攻击的防御方法并不现实，因为防御系统运行的环境是动态的，包含随着时间出现的各种独特攻击。防御系统必须收集在线少样本对抗反馈以迅速增强自身，充分利用内存。因此，我们提出了第一个能够动态适应任何攻击的持续对抗性防御（CAD）框架，其中各种攻击逐个阶段出现。在实践中，CAD基于四项原则进行建模：(1) 持续适应新攻击而无灾难性遗忘，(2) 少样本适应，(3) 内存高效适应，以及(4) 高准确性

    arXiv:2312.09481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: In response to the rapidly evolving nature of adversarial attacks against visual classifiers on a monthly basis, numerous defenses have been proposed to generalize against as many known attacks as possible. However, designing a defense method that generalizes to all types of attacks is not realistic because the environment in which defense systems operate is dynamic and comprises various unique attacks that emerge as time goes on. The defense system must gather online few-shot defense feedback to promptly enhance itself, leveraging efficient memory utilization. Therefore, we propose the first continual adversarial defense (CAD) framework that adapts to any attacks in a dynamic scenario, where various attacks emerge stage by stage. In practice, CAD is modeled under four principles: (1) continual adaptation to new attacks without catastrophic forgetting, (2) few-shot adaptation, (3) memory-efficient adaptation, and (4) high accur
