    Awesome-META+是一个元学习框架集成和学习平台，旨在提供完整可靠的元学习框架应用和面向初学者的学习材料，进而促进元学习的发展并将其从小众领域转化为主流的研究方向。

    

    人工智能已经在经济、产业、教育等各个领域产生了深远的影响，但还存在诸多限制。元学习，也称为“学习如何学习”，为通用人工智能提供了突破目前瓶颈的机会。然而，元学习起步较晚，相比CV、NLP等领域，项目数量较少。每次部署都需要大量的经验去配置环境、调试代码甚至重写，而且框架之间相对孤立。此外，目前针对元学习的专门平台和面向初学者的学习材料相对较少，门槛相对较高。基于此，Awesome-META+提出了一个元学习框架集成和学习平台，旨在解决上述问题并提供完整可靠的元学习框架应用和学习平台。该项目旨在促进元学习的发展，并将其从一个小众领域转化为一个主流的研究方向。

    Artificial intelligence technology has already had a profound impact in various fields such as economy, industry, and education, but still limited. Meta-learning, also known as "learning to learn", provides an opportunity for general artificial intelligence, which can break through the current AI bottleneck. However, meta learning started late and there are fewer projects compare with CV, NLP etc. Each deployment requires a lot of experience to configure the environment, debug code or even rewrite, and the frameworks are isolated. Moreover, there are currently few platforms that focus exclusively on meta-learning, or provide learning materials for novices, for which the threshold is relatively high. Based on this, Awesome-META+, a meta-learning framework integration and learning platform is proposed to solve the above problems and provide a complete and reliable meta-learning framework application and learning platform. The project aims to promote the development of meta-learning and t
