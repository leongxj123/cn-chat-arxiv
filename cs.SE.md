    这篇论文提出了适应现代应用和组织要求的AI-enabled软件和系统架构框架，重点关注机器学习驱动的智能物联网系统(CPS)。作者提出了用于评估和基准化ML-enabled CPS的优点标准。

    

    在文献中提出了几种软件、系统和企业的架构框架。它们识别了各种利益相关者，并定义了架构的观点和视图，以框架和解决利益相关者的关注点。然而，在现有的架构框架中，尚未包括与数据科学和机器学习相关的利益相关者，如数据科学家和数据工程师。因此，它们未能解决响应数据科学社区关注的架构视点和视图。本文通过建立适用于现代应用和组织的架构框架来填补这一空白，其中机器学习工件普遍存在且至关重要。具体而言，我们专注于机器学习驱动的智能物联网系统（CPS），并提出了两组适应CPS高效开发和性能评估的优点标准，即用于评估和基准化机器学习驱动CPS的标准，

    Several architecture frameworks for software, systems, and enterprises have been proposed in the literature. They identified various stakeholders and defined architecture viewpoints and views to frame and address stakeholder concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML) related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be included in existing architecture frameworks. Therefore, they failed to address the architecture viewpoints and views responsive to the concerns of the data science community. In this paper, we address this gap by establishing the architecture frameworks adapted to meet the requirements of modern applications and organizations where ML artifacts are both prevalent and crucial. In particular, we focus on ML-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and propose two sets of merit criteria for their efficient development and performance assessment, namely the criteria for evaluating and benchmarking ML-enabled CPSs, and
