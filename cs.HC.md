    As Good As A Coin Toss Human detection of AI-generated images, videos, audio, and audiovisual stimuli

    [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760)

    通过一项感知研究，评估了人们在日常生活中对合成图像、音频、视频和音视频刺激与真实的区分能力，以探讨人类对欺骗性合成媒体的易受程度。

    

    随着合成媒体变得越来越逼真，使用它的障碍不断降低，这项技术越来越被恶意利用，从金融欺诈到非自愿色情。今天，对抗被合成媒体误导的主要防御依赖于人类观察者在视觉和听觉上区分真假的能力。然而，人们在日常生活中实际上对欺骗性合成媒体有多脆弱仍不清楚。我们进行了一个包含1276名参与者的感知研究，评估人们在区分合成图像、仅音频、仅视频和音视频刺激与真实的准确性如何。为了反映人们在野外可能遇到合成媒体的情况，测试条件和刺激模拟了典型的在线平台，而调查中使用的所有合成媒体均来自

    arXiv:2403.16760v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: As synthetic media becomes progressively more realistic and barriers to using it continue to lower, the technology has been increasingly utilized for malicious purposes, from financial fraud to nonconsensual pornography. Today, the principal defense against being misled by synthetic media relies on the ability of the human observer to visually and auditorily discern between real and fake. However, it remains unclear just how vulnerable people actually are to deceptive synthetic media in the course of their day to day lives. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how accurate people were at distinguishing synthetic images, audio only, video only, and audiovisual stimuli from authentic. To reflect the circumstances under which people would likely encounter synthetic media in the wild, testing conditions and stimuli emulated a typical online platform, while all synthetic media used in the survey was sourced from

    Chatbots as social companions: How people perceive consciousness, human likeness, and social health benefits in machines

    伴侣聊天机器人使用者表示这些关系有益于他们的社会健康，与预期相反，非使用者则认为有害

    

    随着人工智能的普及，一个问题是人工智能与人类互动如何影响人际关系。例如，聊天机器人越来越被用作社交伴侣，尽管有很多猜测，但对他们的使用如何影响人际关系知之甚少。人们普遍认为与伴侣聊天机器人的关系对社会健康有害，但这种假设可能过于简单，特别考虑到用户的社会需求和他们现有人际关系的健康。为了了解与伴侣聊天机器人的关系如何影响社会健康，我们研究了定期使用伴侣聊天机器人和不使用它们的人。与期望相反，伴侣聊天机器人用户表示这些关系对他们的社会健康有益，而非用户则认为它们有害。

    arXiv:2311.10599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widespread, one question that arises is how human-AI interaction might impact human-human interaction. Chatbots, for example, are increasingly used as social companions, and while much is speculated, little is known empirically about how their use impacts human relationships. A common hypothesis is that relationships with companion chatbots are detrimental to social health by harming or replacing human interaction, but this hypothesis may be too simplistic, especially considering the social needs of users and the health of their preexisting human relationships. To understand how relationships with companion chatbots impact social health, we studied people who regularly used companion chatbots and people who did not use them. Contrary to expectations, companion chatbot users indicated that these relationships were beneficial to their social health, whereas non-users viewed them as har
