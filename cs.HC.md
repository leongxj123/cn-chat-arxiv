[^1]: 过于自信和缺乏自信的人工智能阻碍人机协作

    Overconfident and Unconfident AI Hinder Human-AI Collaboration

    人工智能的过度自信和缺乏自信会阻碍人机协作，披露信心水平和提供反馈有助于认识到人工智能的信心不一致，但参与者往往因此不信任人工智能的建议，导致协作结果较差。

    

    随着人工智能的进步，人机协作在专业和日常场景中越来越普遍。在这种协作中，人工智能可以表达其对自己表现的信心水平，作为人类评估人工智能建议的重要指标。然而，人工智能可能表现出过度自信或缺乏自信，即其表达的信心高于或低于其实际表现，这可能导致人们错误地评估人工智能的建议。我们的研究调查了人工智能过度自信和缺乏自信对人类信任、接受人工智能建议和协作结果的影响。我们的研究发现，披露人工智能的信心水平和表现反馈有助于更好地认识人工智能信心不一致。然而，参与者往往会因为察觉到这种不一致而不信任人工智能的建议，导致拒绝人工智能的建议，并且在协作任务中表现更差。相反，没有这些提示的情况下，参与者更容易信任人工智能并接受其建议，从而在协作任务中表现更好。

    As artificial intelligence (AI) advances, human-AI collaboration has become increasingly prevalent across both professional and everyday settings. In such collaboration, AI can express its confidence level about its performance, serving as a crucial indicator for humans to evaluate AI's suggestions. However, AI may exhibit overconfidence or underconfidence--its expressed confidence is higher or lower than its actual performance--which may lead humans to mistakenly evaluate AI advice. Our study investigates the influences of AI's overconfidence and underconfidence on human trust, their acceptance of AI suggestions, and collaboration outcomes. Our study reveal that disclosing AI confidence levels and performance feedback facilitates better recognition of AI confidence misalignments. However, participants tend to withhold their trust as perceiving such misalignments, leading to a rejection of AI suggestions and subsequently poorer performance in collaborative tasks. Conversely, without su
