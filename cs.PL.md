    Ansible Lightspeed是一种基于大型语言模型的服务，专注于将自然语言转换为Ansible代码，为IT自动化领域带来了创新。

    

    大型语言模型（LLMs）的问世使得创建可提高开发者生产力的工具成为可能，集成开发环境（IDEs）常被用作与LLMs交互的接口。已发布许多这类工具，但几乎全部都专注于通用编程语言，很少关注对IT自动化至关重要的特定领域语言。Ansible是一种基于YAML的IT自动化特定语言。Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed与IBM Watson Code Assistant合作的Ansible Lightspeed是一种基于LLM的服务，专门用于将自然语言转换为Ansible代码。

    arXiv:2402.17442v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) which can generate code, has made it possible to create tools that improve developer productivity. Integrated development environments or IDEs which developers use to write software are often used as an interface to interact with LLMs. Although many such tools have been released, almost all of them focus on general-purpose programming languages. Domain-specific languages, such as those crucial for IT automation, have not received much attention. Ansible is one such YAML-based IT automation-specific language. Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed with IBM Watson Code Assistant, further referred to as Ansible Lightspeed, is an LLM-based service designed explicitly for natural language to Ansible code generation.   In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the Ansible Lightspeed service and analyze feedback from thousands of real users. We examine diverse performance indicators, clas
