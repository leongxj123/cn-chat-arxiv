    The Elements of Differentiable Programming

    可微分编程是一个新的编程范式，使得复杂程序能够端对端地进行微分，实现基于梯度的参数优化。

    

    人工智能最近取得了显著进展，这得益于大型模型、庞大数据集、加速硬件，以及可微分编程的变革性力量。这种新的编程范式使复杂计算机程序（包括具有控制流和数据结构的程序）能够进行端对端的微分，从而实现对程序参数的基于梯度的优化。不仅仅是程序的微分，可微分编程也包括了程序优化、概率等多个领域的概念。本书介绍了可微分编程所需的基本概念，并采用了优化和概率两个主要视角进行阐述。

    arXiv:2403.14606v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the t
