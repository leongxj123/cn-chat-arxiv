    本文提出一种新的树生长规则，使广义随机森林在无梯度优化的情况下大大节省了时间。

    

    广义随机森林建立在传统随机森林的基础上，通过将其作为自适应核加权算法来构建估算器，并通过基于梯度的树生长过程来实现。我们提出了一种新的树生长规则，基于定点迭代近似表示梯度近似，实现了无梯度优化，并为此开发了渐近理论。这有效地节省了时间，尤其是在目标量的维度适中时。

    Generalized random forests arXiv:1610.01271 build upon the well-established success of conventional forests (Breiman, 2001) to offer a flexible and powerful non-parametric method for estimating local solutions of heterogeneous estimating equations. Estimators are constructed by leveraging random forests as an adaptive kernel weighting algorithm and implemented through a gradient-based tree-growing procedure. By expressing this gradient-based approximation as being induced from a single Newton-Raphson root-finding iteration, and drawing upon the connection between estimating equations and fixed-point problems arXiv:2110.11074, we propose a new tree-growing rule for generalized random forests induced from a fixed-point iteration type of approximation, enabling gradient-free optimization, and yielding substantial time savings for tasks involving even modest dimensionality of the target quantity (e.g. multiple/multi-level treatment effects). We develop an asymptotic theory for estimators o
