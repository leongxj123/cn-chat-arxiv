    提出了CardioGenAI，一个基于机器学习的框架，用于减少药物的hERG活性并保留药理活性。

    

    药物诱导的心脏毒性是一个重要的健康问题，可能导致严重不良反应，包括通过阻滞电压门控的hERG钾离子通道导致生命威胁的心律失常。因此，开发早期阶段鉴定hERG活性化合物的先进方法，以及优化商业化药物以减少hERG活性非常重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了CardioGenAI，这是一个基于机器学习的框架，用于再设计开发中和已上市药物，以减少hERG活性同时保留其药理活性。该框架结合了用于预测hERG通道活性的最新判别模型，以及钠离子通道NaV1.5和钙离子通道CaV1.2活性，因为它们在调节由hERG通道阻滞引起的心律失常潜在影响中具有潜在意义。这些模型还可以se

    arXiv:2403.07632v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a major health concern which can lead to serious adverse effects including life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias via the blockade of the voltage-gated hERG potassium ion channel. It is therefore of tremendous interest to develop advanced methods to identify hERG-active compounds in early stages of drug development, as well as to optimize commercially available drugs for reduced hERG activity. In this work, we present CardioGenAI, a machine learning-based framework for re-engineering both developmental and marketed drugs for reduced hERG activity while preserving their pharmacological activity. The framework incorporates novel state-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as well as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to their potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced by hERG channel blockade. These models can also se
