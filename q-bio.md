    使用转换器模型进行T细胞响应预测，研究多域结构中的转移学习技术，提出领域感知评估方案。

    

    我们研究特定给定肽段的T细胞响应预测，这可以是向个性化癌症疫苗发展迈出重要一步的关键。

    arXiv:2403.12117v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We study the prediction of T-cell response for specific given peptides, which could, among other applications, be a crucial step towards the development of personalized cancer vaccines. It is a challenging task due to limited, heterogeneous training data featuring a multi-domain structure; such data entail the danger of shortcut learning, where models learn general characteristics of peptide sources, such as the source organism, rather than specific peptide characteristics associated with T-cell response.   Using a transformer model for T-cell response prediction, we show that the danger of inflated predictive performance is not merely theoretical but occurs in practice. Consequently, we propose a domain-aware evaluation scheme. We then study different transfer learning techniques to deal with the multi-domain structure and shortcut learning. We demonstrate a per-source fine tuning approach to be effective across a wide range of peptid
